As we entered a new age in our company, we looked to finding new ways to make dairy products.

Most of which, thankfully enough, ensures the health and safety of our most valued employees: THE COWS!!! They are given a luxury that few ever have, but we can't tell you what it is, that's our secret shhhhh.
